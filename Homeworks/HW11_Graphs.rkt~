; A {X} [Set-of X] is a [List-of X], where order does not matter and all elements are unique.
; A Graph is a (make-graph [Set-of Symbol] [Symbol -> [Set-of Symbol]])
(define-struct graph [nodes neighbors])
; and represents the nodes and edges in a graph.
; The neighbors function is only guaranteed to work for symbols that are in the
; set of nodes, and is guaranteed to return a set of symbols that are also in
; the set of nodes (i.e. the graph is well-formed).
